# Receiving CPDLC / PDC/DCL Clearance

## CPDLC
**Controllerâ€“pilot data link communications (CPDLC)** is a protocol for the transmission of data between a controller and a pilot. The CPDLC protocol is used to transmit data between a controller and a pilot.

It  is a two-way data-link system by which controllers can transmit non urgent 'strategic messages to an aircraft as an alternative to voice communications. The message is displayed on a flight deck visual display. The CPDLC application provides air-ground data communication for the ATC service.


## DLC/PDC
A **Pre-Departure Clearance (PDC)** is an automatic, electronic version of the the IFR clearance you would normally from get from ATC by talking to them over your radio. They are usually sent on client through text message.

A **CPDLC-DLC** or in short **DLC** is a more manual but still electronic version of the IFR clearance.

DLC is available on some airport within Manila FIR, such as **RPLC**, **RPLB**, **RPLL**, **RPVM**, and **RPMD**

All facilities within the Manila FIR are equipped with **PDC** system, on which the controller online can send the clearance for the request made.
