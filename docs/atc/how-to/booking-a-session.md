# Booking a Session

The Philippines vACC utilizes a system of booking sessions and training with **VATPHIL Control Center**!. This tool was designed to controllers and controller-to be to get the most out of their controling.

This serves as a training management system for the controllers. It is a centralized system that allows the controllers to manage their training sessions and to manage the sessions that are booked by the controllers.
